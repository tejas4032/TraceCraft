## About the Project

[üé• Watch the Demo on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHE3K-4kkTg&feature=youtu.be)

Global supply chains today suffer from opacity, inefficiencies, and a lack of verifiable provenance. Our *Supply Chain Transparency Network* harnesses the power of blockchain to ensure every step‚Äîfrom raw material sourcing to final delivery‚Äîis recorded immutably. Through real-time updates, QR-based tracking, and decentralized certification, stakeholders and consumers alike gain confidence in the authenticity and sustainability of the products they handle and purchase.

## Problem Statement

- *Lack of Transparency:* Difficulty verifying true origin and sustainability claims.
- *Inefficiencies:* Manual processes lead to delays and errors.
- *Limited Accountability:* Tainted records undermine trust.

## Solution Overview

1. *Product Registration:* Manufacturers register items on Ethereum smart contracts, embedding product details and certification metadata. A unique QR code is generated for each product.
2. *Real-Time Tracking:* Logistics partners scan QR codes at checkpoints, logging GPS coordinates and timestamps on-chain. No single party can tamper with the record.
3. *Certifying Authority Integration:* Accredited bodies upload validated sustainability credentials (e.g., Fair Trade, Organic) to IPFS; hashes are linked on-chain for immutable proof.
4. *Consumer Transparency:* End-users scan the QR code to trace the entire journey‚Äîview source, certifications, handlers, and final delivery status‚Äîall via a sleek front-end dashboard.
5. *Immutable Ledger:* All interactions are permanently stored on a shared ledger, eliminating data silos and fostering trust.

## Key Features

- üöÄ *Immutable Records:* Blockchain ensures tamper-proof tracking.
- üìç *GPS-Enabled Checkpoints:* Real-time location logs for full visibility.
- üîó *IPFS Integration:* Decentralized storage of certificates and documents.
- üì± *QR Code Interface:* Simple scanning flow for all participants.
- üìä *Stakeholder Dashboards:* Custom views for manufacturers, carriers, certifiers, and consumers.
